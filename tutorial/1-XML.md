# Part 1. What XML is.
XML (Extensible Markup Language) â€” is a markup language and file format for storing, sending, and reconstructing data.There are some benefits to collect data with this language.<br/>
- has few rules to work with it;
- easy to extend data (add new objects);<br/>
- easy to describe data (we can define any attributes for specify object);<br/>
- support any nesting level (we can describe object => inside another object => inside another object ... and so on);
- human-readable language (you can understand what it contains if you can read object data with in English);<br/><br/>
Files of XML format have `.xml` extension.

# Part 2. Recommend software to edit XML.
If you have any programming language experience and still writing code, in this case I recommend to use any integrated development environment (IDE) - Webstorm by JetBrains or Visual Studio Code (VSC) for example.<br/>

But if you haven't any code experience then I recommend to download [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/). Download latest version installer from this link.<br/>
This editor is like basic Windows Notepad but has list of benefits. There are some of them:
- you can open any text file with this editor (just drag-and-drop);
- has tabs with all recent opened files;
- shows string number (at the left) and column number (at the bottom);
- has file syntax highlighting.

Starting this part I will describe explain something with Notepad++ application (screenshots included).

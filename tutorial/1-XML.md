# Part 1. What XML is.
XML (Extensible Markup Language) â€” is a markup language and file format for storing, sending, and reconstructing data.There are some benefits to collect data with this language.<br/>
- has few rules to work with it;
- easy to extend data (add new objects);<br/>
- easy to describe data (we can define any attributes for specify object);<br/>
- support any nesting level (we can describe object => inside another object => inside another object ... and so on);
- human-readable language (you can understand what it contains if you can read object data with in English);<br/><br/>
Files of XML format have `.xml` extension.

# Part 2. Recommend software to edit XML.
If you have any programming language experience and still writing code, in this case I recommend to use any integrated development environment (IDE) - Webstorm by JetBrains or Visual Studio Code (VSC) for example.<br/>

But if you haven't any code experience then I recommend to download [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/). Download latest version installer from this link.<br/>
This editor is like basic Windows Notepad but has list of benefits. There are some of them:
- you can open any text file with this editor (just drag-and-drop);
- has tabs with all recent opened files;
- shows string number (at the left) and column number (at the bottom);
- has file syntax highlighting.

Starting this part I will describe explain something with Notepad++ application (screenshots included).

# Part 2.1. How to use Notepad++.
After installing Notepad++ on right-click on any file you will see "Open in Notepad++" option. If not, you can open file with Notepad++ with drag-and-drop to application tab or using "Open with" option.<br/><br/>
You can open many files inside one application window and moving between them (instead of many Windows Notepads). You can drag-and-drop any file from file tab (at the top) to the right side: you will see split window, each part will have its own files tab. Now you can expore and edit 2 files at same time.<br/><br/>
When you start to edit your file you will notice that "floppy disk" icon's color changed from blue to red. It indicates that you have unsaved changes. Click to `File => Save` to save current file.

Some useful tips:
- right-click to file on tab to close:
  - all files;
  - all except current;
  - all the left/right;
- click to View at settings tab (at the top) and click on "Word wrap" option for showing long string in many strings according your window size (this option doesn't change file).

Some useful shortcuts:
- save file: `Ctrl+S`;
- search in current file: `Ctrl+F`; 
- search in all files of specify folder: `Ctrl+Shift+F`;
- replace: `Ctrl+H`;

# Chapter III: Minimal GitHub usage and BBG Repository guidelines.

#### Important note: you can skip this chapter and just drop your file and `Database.log` file to #translator-chat, but if you read this and will be able to make these steps then you will save a lot of BBG Devs' and Chef-Translator's (me) time.

# Part 1. GitHub account and required software.
You need to register GitHub account and download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com). After you downloaded and installed app, authorize to it.

# Part 2. Basic concepts.
- *Repository* - folder of project that contains all files, their change history, all branches and pull-requests.
- *Clone repository* - download repository.
- *Fork* - private copy of repository that contains all files present at the time of creation.
- *Branch* - isolated parallel repository. Every branch should be based on another branch and contain files from based branch. Every repository has `main` branch. Branches can be merged in one branch.
- *Commit* - record about changing one or more files in branch.
- *Pull-request (PR)* - request to move changes from external branch to one of local branches.
- *Merge* - process of integration two branches to one.

# Part 3. How to handle BBG Mod repository and get language file you need.
1. Create fork of BBG repository. Go to [BBG Mod repository](https://github.com/CivilizationVIBetterBalancedGame/BetterBalancedGame) and click "Fork" button. Uncheck "Copy the `main` branch only" option and push green "Create fork" button. Now you have forked source repository. Be sure that your **branch** is up-to-date: click to "Sync fork" button and update **your current work branch**, otherwise "Update branch" button will be disabled.
